            SUre we have Poets, that did never dreame<br />
            Upon Parnassus, nor did taste the streame <a href="#note2"><sup>2</sup></a><br />
            Of Helicon, and therefore I suppose <a href="#note3"><sup>3</sup></a><br />
            Those made not Poets, but the Poets those.<br />
            And as Courts make not Kings, but Kings the Court, <a href="#note4"><sup>4</sup></a><br />
            So where the Muses and their Troopes resort,<br />
            Parnassus stands, if I can be to thee,<br />
            A Poet, thou Parnassus art to mee.<br />
            Nor wonder, if(advantag'd in my flight,<br />
            By taking wing from thy auspicious height)<br />
            I brough untrac't wayes and ayry paths I flye,<br />
            More boundlesse in my fancy then my eye,<br />
            
            Exalted to this height, I first looke downe<br />
            On Pauls, as men from thence upon the towne. <a href="#note5"><sup>5</sup></a><br />

            Hath bravely reacht and soard above thy height:<br />

            Or Zeale(more fierce then they) thy fall conspire,<a href="#note8"><sup>8</sup></a><br />
            Secure, while thee the best of Poets sings,<br />
            Preserv'd from ruine by the best of Kings.<a href="#note9"><sup>9</sup></a><br />
            As those who rais'd in body,or in thought<br />
            Above the Earth,or the Ayres middle Vault,<br />

            How clouds condense to raine,congeale to snow,<br />

            Yet all in vaine,increasing with their store,<br />
            Their vast desires,but make their wants the more.<br />
            
            As food to unsound bodies, though it please<br />
            The Appetite,feeds onley the disease,<br />
            Where with like haste,though severall wayes they runne<br />
            Some to undoe, and some to be undone:<br />
            While Luxurie,and wealth,like Warre and Peace,<br />
            Are each the others ruine,and increase,<br />
            As Rivers lost in Seas some secret veine<br />
            Thence reconveighs, there to be lost againe.<br />
            Some study plots, and some those plots t'undoe,<br />

            False to their hopes, affraid to be secure<br />
            Those mischiefes onely which they make, endure,<br />
            Blinded with light,and sicke of being well,<br />

            Beauty with strength) above the valley swels<br />
            Into my eye, as the late married Dame,<br />
            (Who proud,yet seems to make that pride her shame)<br />
            
            When Nature quickens in her pregnant wombe<br />
            Her wishes past,and now her hopes to come:<br />
            With such an easie,and unforc'd Ascent,<br />
            Windsor her gentle bosome doth present ;<br />
            Where no stupendious Cliffe,no threatening heights<br />
            Accesse deny,no horrid steepe affrigts,<br />
            But such a Rise, as doth at once invite<br />
            A pleasure,and a reverence from the fight.<br />
            Thy Masters Embleme,in whose face I saw <a href="#note13"><sup>13</sup></a><br />
            A friend-like sweetnesse, and a King-like aw,<br />
            Where Majestie and love so mixt appeare,<br />
            Both gently kinde,both royally severe.<br />
            So Windsor,humble in it selfe,seemes proud,<br />
            To be the Base of that Majesticke load,<br />
            Than which no hill a nobler burthen beares,<br />
            But Atlas onely,that supports the spheres,<br />
            Nature this mount so fitly did advance,<br />
            We might conclude,that nothing is by chance<br />
            So plac't, as if she did on purpose raise<br />
            The Hill, to rob the builder of his praise.<br />
            
            For none commends his judgement, that doth chuse<br />
            That which a blind man onely could refuse;<br />
            Such are the Towers which th'hoary Temples grac'd<br />

            It gave a Cradle, or to whom a Tombe,<br />

            That from those Kings,who then thy captives were,<br />

            Who should possesse all that thy mighty power,<br />

            That all the blood he spilt,had been his owne,<br />
            Thou hadst extended through the conquer'd East,<br />
            Thine and the Christian name,and made them blest<br />
            To serve thee,while that losse this gaine would bring,<br />
            Christ for their God,and Edward for their King;<br />
            
            <p class="sideNote">St.George</p>
            When thou that Saint thy Patron didst designe,<br />

            (Who evill thinks may evill him confound )<br />
            The English Armes encircle,thou didst seeme<a href="#note34"><sup>34</sup></a><br />
            But to foretell, and Prophecie of him,<br />
            Who has within that Azure round confin'd<br />
            These Realmes,which Nature for their bound design'd.<br />
            
            That bound which to the worlds extreamest ends,<br />
            Endlesse her selfe,her liquid armes extends ;<br />
            In whose Heroicke face I see the Saint<br />

            Companion of that sacred Order be.<br />
            Here could I fix my wonder,but our eyes,<br />
            Nice as our tastes,affect varieties;<br />
            And though one please him most,the hungry guest<br />
            Tasts every dish,and runs through all the feast ;<br />
            So having tasted Windsor,casting round<br />
            My wandring eye,an emulous Hill doth bound,<br />
            
            <p class="sideNote">St. Annes Hill.</p>
            My more contracted sight,whose top of late<br />

            Tell me ( my Muse ) what monstrous dire Offence?<br />
            What crime could any Christian King incense<br />
            
            To such a rage? Wast Luxurie,or Lust?<br />
            Was he so temperate,so chast,so just?<br />
            Were these their crimes ; they were his owne, much more<br />
            But they ( alas ) were rich,and he was poore ;<br />
            And having spent the treasures of his Crowne,<br />
            Condemnes their Luxurie,to feed his owne;<br />
            And yet this act,to varnish o're the shame<br />
            Of sacriledge, must beare devotions name,<br />
            And he might thinke it just the cause,and time<br />
            Considered well,for none commits a crime<br />
            Appearing such,but as 'tis understood,<br />
            A reall,or at least a seeming good.<br />
            While for the Church his learned Pen disputes<a href="#note38"><sup>38</sup></a><br />
            His much more learned sword his Pen confutes.<br />
            Thus to the Ages past he makes amends,<br />
            Their charity destroyes,their faith defends.<a href="#note39"><sup>39</sup></a><br />
            Then did Religion in a lazie Cell,<br />
            In emptie,ayrie contemplations dwell ,<br />
            And like the block unmoved lay,but ours<br />
            As much too active like the Storke devours.<br />
            
            Is there no temperate Region can be knowne,<br />
            Betwixt their frigid, and our Torrid Zone?<br />
            Could we not wake from that Lethargick dreame,<br />
            But to be restlesse in a worse extreame?<br />
            And for that Lethargy was there no cure,<br />
            But to be cast into a Calenture?<a href="#note40"><sup>40</sup></a><br />
            Can knowledge have no bound,but must advance<br />
            So farre,to make us wish for ignorance?<br />
            And rather in the darke to grope our way,<br />
            Then led by a false guide to erre by day?<br />
            Parting from thence 'twixt anger,shame,and feare<br />
            Those for what's past,and this for what's too neare:<br />
            My eye discending from the Hill, survayes<br />
            Where Thames amongst the wanton valleyes strayes<br />
            
            <p class="sideNote">Thames.</p>
            Thames the most loud of all the Oceans sonnes,<br />
            By his old fire to his imbraces runnes,<br />
            Hasting to pay his tribute to the Sea,<br />
            Like mortall life to meet Eternity,<br />
            And though his clearer sand no golden veynes,<br />
            Like Tagus<a href="#note42"><sup>42</sup></a>,and Pactolus<a href="#note43"><sup>43</sup></a>
            streames containe,<br />
            
            His genuine,and less guilty wealth t'explore,<br />
            Search not his bottome,but behold his shore;<br />
            O're which he kindly spreads his spacious wing,<br />
            And hatches plenty for th'ensuing Spring,<br />
            Nor with a furious,and unruly wave,<br />
            Like profuse Kings,resumes the wealth he gave,<br />
            No unexpected Inundations spoyle,<br />
            The Mowers hopes,nor mocke the Plough-mans toyle;<br />
            Then like a Lover he forsakes his shores,<br />
            Whose stay with jealous eyes his spouse implores ;<br />
            Till with a parting kisse he saves her teares,<br />
            And promising returne,secures her feares ;<br />
            As a wise King first settles fruitfull peace<br />
            In his owne Realmes,and with their rich increase,<br />
            Seeks warre abroad,and then in triumph brings<br />
            The spoyles of Kingdomes,and the Crownes of Kings.<br />
            So Thames to London doth at first present<br />
            Those tributes,which the neighbouring countries sent,<br />
            But as his second visit from the East,<br />
            Spices he brings, and treasures from the West.<br />
            
            Findes wealth where 'tis,and gives it where it wants<br />
            Cities in Desarts,woods in Cities plants,<br />
            Rounds the whole Globe,and with his flying towers<br />
            Brings home to us,and makes both Indies ours<a href="#note44"><sup>44</sup></a><br />
            So that to us no thing, no place is strange<br />
            Whilst thy faire bosome is the worlds Exchange:<a href="#note45"><sup>45</sup></a><br />
            O could my verse freely and smoothly flow,<br />
            As thy pure flood,heaven should no longer know<br />
            Her old Eridanus<a href="#note46"><sup>46</sup></a>, thy purer streams<br />
            Should bathe the gods,and be the Poets Theame.<br />
            Here Nature whether more intent to please<br />

            Wisely she knew the harmony of things<br />
            Aswell, as that of sounds from discords springs,<br />

            By vulgar hands, but if he can descry<br />
            
            Some Nobler foes approach, to him he cals<br />
            And begs his fate, and then contented fals :<br />
            So the tall Stagge, amids the lesser hounds<br />
            Repels their force, and wounds returne for wounds,<br />
            Till Charles from his unerring hand lets flie<br />

            Runny Mead where the great Charter<a href="#note66"><sup>66</sup></a> was first
            sealed.
            Faire liberty pursude, and meant a Prey<br />
            To tyranny, here turn'd, and stood at bay.<br />
            When in that remedy all hope was plac't<br />
            Which was, or should have been at least the last.<br />
            For armed subjects can have no pretence<br />
            Against their Princes, but their just defence,<br />
            And whether then, or no, I leave to them<br />
            To justifie, who else themselves condemnes<br />
            Yet might the fact be just, if we may guesse<br />
            The justnesse of an action from successe<br />
            
            Here was that Charter seal'd, wherein the Crowne<br />
            
            <p class="sideNote">Magna Charta.</p>
            All markes of Arbitrary power layes downe:<br />
            Tyrant and Slave, those names of hate and feare,<br />
            The happier style of King and Subject beare:<br />
            Happy when both to the same Center move,<br />
            When Kings give liberty, and Subjects love.<br />
            Therefore not long in force this Charter stood<br />
            Wanting that seale, it must be seal'd in blood.<br />
            The subjects arm'd,the more their Princes gave,<br />
            But this advantage tooke, the more to crave:<br />
            Till Kings by giving, give themselves away,<br />
            And even that power,that should deny, betray,<br />
            "Who gives constrain'd, but his owne feare reviles<br />
            "Not thank't, but scorn'd, nor are they gifts, but spoyles.<br />
            And they, whom no denyall can withstand,<br />
            Seeme but to aske, while they indeed command.<br />
            Thus all to limit Royalty conspire,<br />
            While each forgets to limit his desire.<br />
            
            Till Kings like old Anteus<a href="#note68"><sup>68</sup></a> by their fall,<br />
            Being forc't, their courage from despaire recall.<br />
            When a calme River rais'd with sudden raines,<br />
            Or Snowes dissolv'd o'reflowes th'adjoyning Plaines<br />
            The Husbandmen<a href="#note69"><sup>69</sup></a> with high rais'd bankes secure<br />
            Their greedy hopes, and this he can endure.<br />
            But if with Bogs, and Dammes they strive to force,<br />
            His channell to a new,or narrow course.<br />
            No longer then within his bankes he dwels,<br />
            First to a Torrent, then a Deluge swels<br />
            Stronger,and fiercer by restraint he roares,<br />
            And knowes no bound, but makes his powers his shores:<br />
            Thus Kings by grasping more then they can hold,<br />
            First made their Subjects by oppressions bold,<br />
            And popular sway by forcing Kings to give<br />
            More, then was fit for Subjects to receive,<br />
            Ranne to the same extreame, and one excesse<br />
            Made both by stirring to be greater, lesse.<br />
            
            Nor any way, but seeking to have more<br />
            Makes either loose, what each possest before.<br />
            Therefore their boundlesse power tell Princes draw<br />
            Within the Channell, and the shores of Law,<br />
            And may that Law, which teaches Kings to swat<br />
            Their Scepters, teach their Subjects to obey.<br />
            
            
            FINIS.
