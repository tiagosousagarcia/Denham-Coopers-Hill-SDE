               <l>Happy when both to the same Center move,</l>

               <l>Stronger,and fiercer by restraint he roares,</l>
               <l>And knowes no bound, but makes his powers his shores:</l>
               <l>Thus Kings by grasping more then they can hold,</l>
               <l>First made their Subjects by oppressions bold,</l>
               <l>And popular sway by forcing Kings to give</l>
               <l>More,then was fit for Subjects to receive,</l>
               <l>Ranne to the same extreame, and one excesse</l>
