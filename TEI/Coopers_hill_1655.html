            Had thy great destiny but given thee skill,<br />
            To know as well, as power to act her will,<br />

            Who should possesse all that thy mighty power,<br />

            To whom their better Fate reserves what ere<br />
            The Victor hopes for, or the Vanquisht feare;<br />
            
            That blood, which thou and thy great Grandsire shed,<br />
            And all that since these sister Nations bled,<br />
            Had bin unspilt, had happy Edward known<br />
            That all the blood he spilt, had been his own.<br />
            When he that Patron<a href="#note32"><sup>32</sup></a> chose,in whom are joyn'd<br />
            Souldier and Martyr,and his arms confin'd<br />
            Within the Azure Circle, he did seem<br />
            But to foretel, and prophecie of him,<br />
            Who to his Realms that Azure round hath joyn'd,<br />
            Which Nature for their bound at first design'd.<br />
            That bound,which to the Worlds extreamest ends,<br />
            Endlesse it selfe, its liquid arms extends;<br />
            He, who not needs that Embleme which we paint,<br />
            But is himself the Souldier and the Saint.<a href="#note33"><sup>33</sup></a><br />
            Here should my wonder dwell,and here my praise,<br />
            But my fixt thoughts my wandring eye betrays,<br />
            Viewing a neighboring hill<a href="#note34"><sup>34</sup></a>, whose top of late<br />
            A Chappel crown'd, till in the Common Fate,<br />
            The adjoyning Abby<a href="#note35"><sup>35</sup></a>
            fell<a href="#note36"><sup>36</sup></a>:(may no such storme<br />
            Fall on our times, where ruine must reform.)<br />
            
            Tell me (my Muse) what monstrous dire Offence,<br />
            What crime could any Christian incense<br />
            To such a rage? was't Luxury? or lust?<br />
            Was he so temperate,so chast,so just?<br />
            Were these their crimes? they were his own much (more:<br />
            But wealth is Crime enough to him that's poor,<br />
            Who having spent the Treasures of his Crown,<br />
            Condemns their Luxury to feed his own.<br />
            And yet this Act, to varnish o're the shame<br />
            Of sacriledge, must bear devotions name.<br />
            No Crime so bold,but would be understood<br />
            A reall,or at least a seeming good.<br />
            Who fears not to do ill, yet fears the Name,<br />
            And free from Conscience, is a slave to Fame.<br />
            Thus he the Church at once protects, and spoyles:<br />
            But Princes swords are sharper then their styles.<br />
            And thus to th'ages past he makes amends,<br />
            Their Charity destroyes,their Faith defends.<a href="#note37"><sup>37</sup></a><br />
            Then did Religion in a lazie Cell ,<br />
            In emptie, airie contemplations dwell;<br />
            
            And like the block, unmoved lay: but ours,<br />
            As much too active, like the storke devours.<br />
            Is there no temperate Region can be knowne,<br />
            Betwixt their Frigid,and our Torrid Zone?<br />
            Could we not wake from that Lethargicke Dreame,<br />
            But to be restlesse in a worse extreame?<br />
            And for that Lethargy was there no cure,<br />
            But to be cast into a Calenture?<a href="#note38"><sup>38</sup></a><br />
            Can knowledge have no bound, but must advance<br />
            So farre, to make us wish for ignorance?<br />
            And rather in the darke to grope our way,<br />
            Then led by a false guide to erre by day?<br />
            Who sees these dismall heaps,but would demand,<br />
            What barbarous Invader sackt the land?<br />
            But when he heares, no Goth<a href="#note39"><sup>39</sup></a>, no Turk<a href="#note40"><sup>40</sup></a> did
            bring<br />
            This desolation, but a Christian King;<br />
            When nothing, but the Name of Zeale, appeares<br />
            'Twixt our best actions and the worst of theirs,<br />
            What does he think our Sacriledge would spare,<br />
            When such th'effects of our devotions are?<br />
            
            Parting from thence 'twixt anger, shame, and feare,<br />
            Those for what's past, and this for what's too neare:<br />
            My eye descending from the Hill, survaies<br />
            Where Thames amongst the wanton vallies
            strayes.<br />
            Thames, the most lov'd of all the Oceans

            <p class="sideNote">Thames.</p><br />
            By his old Sire, to his imbraces runnes,<br />
            Hasting to pay his tribute to the Sea,<br />
            Like mortall life to meet Eternity.<br />
            Though with those streames he no resemblance hold,<br />
            Whose foame is Amber, and their Gravell Gold;<br />
            His genuine, and lesse guilty wealth t'explore,<br />
            Search not his bottom, but survey his shore;<br />
            Ore which he kindly spreads his spacious wing,<br />
            And hatches plenty for th'ensuing Spring.<br />
            Nor then destroyes it with too fond a stay,<br />
            Like Mothers which their Infats overlay.<br />
            Nor with a suddain and impetuous wave,<br />
            Like profuse Kings, resumes the wealth he gave.<br />
            No unexpected inundations spoyle<br />
            The mowers hopes, nor mock the plowmans toyle:<br />
            
            But Godlike his unwearied Bounty flows ;<br />
            First loves to do, then loves the Good he does.<br />
            Nor are his Blessings to his banks confin'd,<br />
            But free, and common, as the Sea or Wind;<br />
            When he to boast, or to disperse his stores<br />
            Full of the tributes of his gratefull shores,<br />
            Visits the World, and in his flying towers<br />
            Brings home to us, and makes both Indies ours;<a href="#note42"><sup>42</sup></a><br />
            Finds wealth where 'tis, bestows it where it wants,<br />
            Citties in deserts, woods in Cities plants.<br />
            So that to us no thing, no place is strange,<br />
            While his fayre bosome is the worlds exchange.<a href="#note43"><sup>43</sup></a><br />
            O could I flow like thee, and make thy streame<br />
            My great example, as it is my theme !<br />
            Though deep, yet cleare, though Gentle, yet not dull,<br />
            Strong without rage, without 'ore-flowing full.<br />
            Here Nature, whether more intent to please 
            <p class="sideNote">The Forrest.</p><br />
            Us,or her selfe, with strange varieties,<br />
            (For things of wonder give no lesse delight<br />
            To the wise Maker's, then beholder's sight.<br />
            
            Though these delights from severall causes move,<br />
            For so our children, thus our friends we love)<br />
            Wisely she knew, the harmony of things,<br />
            As well as that of sounds, from discords springs.<br />
            Such was the discord, which did first disperse<br />
            Forme, order, beauty through the Universe;<br />
            While drynesse moysture, coldnesse heat resists,<a href="#note45"><sup>45</sup></a><br />
            All that we have, and that we are, subsists.<br />
            While the steepe horrid roughnesse of the Wood<br />
            Strives with the gentle calmenesse of the flood.<br />
            Such huge extreames when Nature doth unite,<br />
            Wonder from thence results, from thence delight.<br />
            The streame is so transparent,pure,and cleare,<br />
            That had the selfe-enamour'd youth gaz'd here,

            While he the bottome, not his face had seene.<br />
            But his proud head the ayery Mountaine hides<br />
            Among the Clouds; his shoulders, and his sides<br />
            A shady mantle cloaths; his curled brows<br />
            Frowne on the Gentle streame, which calmly flows,<br />
            
            While winds and stormes his lofty forhead beat:<br />
            The common fate of all that's high, or great.<br />
            Low at his foot a spacious plaine is plac't,<br />
            Between the mountaine and the streame imbrac't :<br />
            Which shade and shelter from the Hill derives,<br />
            While the kind river wealth and beauty gives ;<br />
            And in the mixture of all these appeares<br />
            Variety, which all the rest indears.<br />
            This scene had some bold Greek, or Brittish Bard<a href="#note48"><sup>48</sup></a><br />

            Give leave to slacken, and unbend his cares,<br />
            Attended to the Chase by all the flower<br />
            Of youth, whose hopes a Nobler prey devoure:<br />
            Pleasure with Praise, and danger, they would buy,<br />
            And with a foe that would not only fly.<br />
            The stagg<a href="#note52"><sup>52</sup></a> now conscious of his fatall
            Growth,<br />
            At once indulgent to his feare and sloth,<br />
            To some darke covert his retreat had made,<br />
            Where nor mans eye, nor heavens should invade<br />
            His soft repose; when th'unexpected sound<br />
            Of doggs, and men, his wakefull eare doth wound.<br />
            Rouz'd with the noyse, he scarse believes his eare,<br />
            Willing to think th'illusions of his feare<br />
            Had given this false Alar'm, but straight his view<br />
            Confirmes, that more than all he feares is true.<br />
            Betray'd in all his strengths, the wood beset,<br />
            All instruments, all Arts of ruine met;<br />
            He calls to mind his strength, and then his speed,<br />
            His winged heeles, and then his armed head;<br />
            
            With these t'avoyd, with that his Fate to meet:<br />
            But feare prevails, and bids him trust his feet.<br />
            So fast he flyes, that his reviewing eye<br />
            Has lost the chasers, their Nobler sense<br />
            Their disproportion'd speed does recompense.<br />
            Then curses his conspiring feet, whose scent<br />
            Betrayes that safety which their swiftnesse lent.<br />
            Then tryes his friends, among the baser heard,<br />
            Where he so lately was obey'd, and fear'd,<br />
            His safety seeks: the heard, unkindly wise,<a href="#note53"><sup>53</sup></a><br />
            Or chases him from thence, or from him flyes.<br />
            Like a declining Statesman, left forlorne<br />
            To his friends pitty, and pursuers scorne,<br />
            With shame remembers, while himsefe was one<br />
            Of the same heard, himselfe the same had done.<br />
            Thence to the coverts, and the conscious Groves,<br />
            The scenes of his past triumphs, and his loves;<br />
            Sadly surveying where he rang'd alone<br />
            Prince of the soyle, and all the heard his owne ;<br />
            
            And like a bold Knight Errant did proclaime<br />
            Combat to all, and bore away the Dame;<br />
            And taught the woods to eccho to the streame<br />
            His dreadfull challenge, and his clashing beame.<br />
            Yet faintly now declines the fatall strife ;<br />
            So much his love was dearer then his life.<br />
            Now every lease, and every moving breath<br />
            Presents a foe, and every foe a death.<br />
            Wearied, forsaken, and pursu'd, at last<br />
            All safety in despaire of safety plac'd,<br />
            Courage he thence resumes, resolv'd to beare<br />
            All their assaults, since 'tis in vaine to feare.<br />
            And now too late he wishes for the fight<br />
            That strength he wasted in Ignoble flight:<br />
            But when he sees the eager chase renew'd,<br />
            Himselfe by doggs, the doggs by men pursu'd:<br />
            He straight revokes his bold resolve, and more<br />
            Repents his courage, then his feare before;<br />
            Finds that uncertaine waies unsafest are,<br />
            And Doubt a greater mischief then Despaire.<br />
            
            Then to the streame, when neither friends, nor force,<br />
            Nor speed, nor Art availe, he shapes his course;<br />
            Thinks not their rage so desperate t' assay,<br />
            An Element, more mercilesse then they.<br />
            But feareless they pursue, nor can the flood<br />
            Quench their dire thirst; alas, they thirst for blood.<br />
            So towards a Ship the oarefin'd Gallyes ply,<br />
            Which wanting Sea to ride, or wind to fly,<br />
            Stands but to fall reveng'd on those that dare<br />
            Tempt the last fury of extreame despayre.<br />
            So fares the Stagg among th'inraged hounds,<br />
            Repells their force, and wounds returns for wounds.<br />
            And as a Hero, whom his baser foes<br />
            In troops surround, now these assailes, now those,<br />
            Though prodigall of life, disdaines to dy<br />
            By common hands; but if he can descry<br />
            Some nobler foes approach, to him he calls,<br />
            And beggs his Fate, and then contented falls.<br />
            So when the King a mortall shaft lets fly<br />
            From his unerring hand, then glad to dy,<br />
            
            Proud of the wound, to it resigns his blood,<br />
            And staines the Christall with a Purple flood.<br />
            This a more Innocent, and happy chase,<br />
