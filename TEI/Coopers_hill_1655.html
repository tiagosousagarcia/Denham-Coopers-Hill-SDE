               Narcissus was famed for his beauty and his disdain
               for those who loved him. In Ovid's
               <span class="italic">Metamorphoses</span>, Echo, a nymph, falls
               in love with him. Narcissus shuns her love and for
               that is punished by Aphrodite, who makes him fall in
               love with his own reflection and transforms him into
               a flower.

            derived from Brendan O Hehir's <span class="italic">Expans'd hieroglyphicks: a

            The text was encoded in <a href="https://tei-c.org/">TEI</a>-XML
