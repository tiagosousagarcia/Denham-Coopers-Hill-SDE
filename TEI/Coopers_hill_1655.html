shame</div><div class="l">Of sacriledge,must bear devotions name.</div><div class="l">No Crime so bold,but would be understood</div><div class="l">A reall,or at least a seeming good.</div><div class="l">Who fears not to do ill,yet fears the Name,</div><div class="l">And free from Conscience,is a slave to Fame.</div><div class="l">Thus he the Church at once protects, and spoyles:</div><div

fond a stay,</div><div class="l">Like Mothers which their Infats overlay.</div><div class="l">Nor with a suddain and impetuous wave,</div><div class="l">Like profuse Kings, resumes the wealth he gave.</div><div class="l">No unexpected inundations spoyle</div><div class="l">The mowers hopes, nor mock the plowmans toyle :</div><div class="l">But Godlike his unwearled Bounty flows ;</div><div class="l">First loves to do, then loves the Good he does.</div><div class="l">Nor are his Blessings to his banks confin'd,</div><div class="l">But free,and common,as the Sea or Wind ;</div><div

plants.</div><div class="l">So that to us no thing, no place is strange,</div><div class="l">While his fayre bosome is the worlds exchange.</div><div class="l">O could I flow like thee, and make thy streame</div><div class="l">My great example,as it is my theme !</div><div class="l">Though deep,yet cleare,though Gentle,yet not dull,</div><div class="l">Strong without rage, without 'ore-flowing full.</div><div class="l">Here Nature, whether more intent to please [The Forrest.</div><div class="l">Us,or her selfe, with strange varieties,</div><div class="l">(For things of wonder give no lesse delight</div><div class="l">To the wise Maker's,then beholder's sight.</div><div class="l">Though these delights from severall causes move,</div><div class="l">For so our children, thus our friends we love)</div><div class="l">Wisely she knew, the harmony of things,</div><div class="l">As well as that of sounds, from discords springs.</div><div class="l">Such was the discord, which did first disperse</div><div class="l">Forme,order, beauty through the Universe;</div><div class="l">While drynesse moysture, coldnesse heat resists,</div><div class="l">All that we have,and that we are, subsists.</div><div class="l">While the steepe horrid roughnesse of the Wood</div><div class="l">Strives with the gentle calmenesse of the flood.</div><div class="l">Such huge extreames when Nature doth unite,</div><div class="l">Wonder from thence results, from thence delight.</div><div class="l">The streame is so transparent,pure,and cleare,</div><div class="l">That had the selfe-enamour'd youth gaz'd here, [Narcis-sus.</div><div class="l">So fatally deceiv'd he had not been,</div><div class="l">While he the bottome,not his face had seene.</div><div class="l">But his proud head the ayery Mountaine hides</div><div class="l">Among the Clouds ; his shoulders,and his sides</div><div class="l">A shady mantle cloaths; his curled brows</div><div class="l">Frowne on the Gentle streame, which calmly flows,</div><div class="l">While winds and stormes his lofty forhead beat :</div><div class="l">The common fate of all that's high, or great.</div><div class="l">Low at his foot a spacious plaine is plac't,</div><div class="l">Between the mountaine and the streame imbrac't :</div><div class="l">Which shade and shelter from the Hill derives,</div><div class="l">While the kind river wealth and beauty gives ;</div><div class="l">And in the mixture of all these appeares</div><div class="l">Variety, which all the rest indears.</div><div class="l">This scene had some bold Greek, or Brittish Bard</div><div class="l">Beheld of old, what stories had we heard,</div><div class="l">Of Faries, Satyrs,and the Nymphs their Dames,</div><div class="l">Their feasts, their revells,and their amorous flames!</div><div class="l">'Tis still the same, although their ayery shape</div><div class="l">All but a quick Poetick sight escape.</div><div class="l">There Faunus and Sylvanus keepe their Courts,</div><div class="l">And thither all the horned hoast resorts,</div><div class="l">To graze the rancker meade,that noble heard,</div><div class="l">On whose sublime and shady fronts is reard</div><div class="l">Natures great Masterpeece ; to shew how soone</div><div class="l">Great things are made,but sooner are undone.</div><div class="l">Here have I seene the King, when great affaires</div><div class="l">Give leave to slacken, and unbend his cares,</div><div class="l">Attended to the Chase by all the flower</div><div class="l">Of youth,whose hopes a Nobler prey devoure:</div><div class="l">Pleasure with Praise, and danger,they would buy,</div><div class="l">And with a foe that would not only fly.</div><div class="l">The stagg now conscious of his fatall Growth,</div><div class="l">At once indulgent to his feare and sloth,</div><div class="l">To some darke covert his retreat had made,</div><div class="l">Where nor mans eye, nor heavens should invade</div><div class="l">His soft repose ; when th'unexpected sound</div><div class="l">Of doggs, and men,his wakefull eare doth wound.</div><div class="l">Rouz'd with the noyse, he scarse believes his eare,</div><div class="l">Willing to think th'illusions of his feare</div><div class="l">Had given this false Alar'm,but straight his view</div><div class="l">Confirmes,that more than all he feares is true.</div><div class="l">Betray'd in all his strengths, the wood beset,</div><div class="l">All instruments, all Arts of ruine met ;</div><div class="l">He calls to mind his strength, and then his speed,</div><div class="l">His winged heeles, and then his armed head;</div><div class="l">With these t'avoyd, with that his Fateto meet :</div><div class="l">But feare prevails, and bids him trust his feet.</div><div class="l">So fast he flyes, that his reviewing eye</div><div class="l">Has lost the chasers, their Nobler sense</div><div class="l">Their disproportion'd speed does recompense.</div><div class="l">Then curses his conspiring feet, whose scent</div><div class="l">Betrayes that safety which their swiftnesse lent.</div><div class="l">Then tryes his friends, among the baser heard,</div><div class="l">Where he so lately was obey'd, and fear'd,</div><div class="l">His safety seeks:the heard, unkindly wise,</div><div class="l">Or chases him from thence, or from him flyes.</div><div class="l">Like a declining Statesman,left forlorne</div><div class="l">To his friends pitty,and pursuers scorne,</div><div class="l">With shame remembers, while himsefe was one</div><div class="l">Of the same heard,himselfe the same had done.</div><div class="l">Thence to the coverts,and the conscious Groves,</div><div class="l">The scenes of his past triumphs,and his loves;</div><div class="l">Sadly surveying where he rang'd alone</div><div class="l">Prince of the soyle,and all the heard his owne ;</div><div class="l">And like a bold Knight Errant did proclaime</div><div class="l">Combat to all,and bore away the Dame;</div><div class="l">And taught the woods to eccho to the streame</div><div class="l">His dreadfull challenge,and his clashing beame.</div><div class="l">Yet faintly now declines the fatall strife ;</div><div class="l">So much his love was dearer then his life.</div><div class="l">Now every lease, and every moving breath</div><div class="l">Presents a foe, and every foe a death.</div><div class="l">Wearied, forsaken, and pursu'd, at last</div><div class="l">All safety in despaire of safety plac'd,</div><div class="l">Courage he thence resumes, resolv'd to beare</div><div class="l">All their assaults,since 'tis in vaine to feare.</div><div class="l">And now too late he wishes for the fight</div><div class="l">That strength he wasted in Ignoble flight :</div><div class="l">But when he sees the eager chase renew'd,</div><div class="l">Himselfe by doggs, the doggs by men pursu'd :</div><div class="l">He striaght revokes his bold resolve, and more</div><div class="l">Repents his courage,then his feare before ;</div><div class="l">Finds that uncertaine waies unsafest are,</div><div class="l">And Doubt a greater mischief then Despaire.</div><div class="l">Then to the streame, when neither friends, norforce,</div><div class="l">Nor speed,nor Art availe, he shapes his course;</div><div class="l">Thinks not their rage so desperate t' assay,</div><div class="l">An Element, more mercilesse then they.</div><div class="l">But feareless they pursue, nor can the flood</div><div class="l">Quench their dire thirst ; alas, they thirst for blood.</div><div class="l">So towards a Ship the oarefin'd Gallyes ply,</div><div class="l">Which wanting Sea to ride, or wind to fly,</div><div class="l">Stands but to fall reveng'd on those that dare</div><div class="l">Tempt the last fury of extreame despayre.</div><div class="l">So fares the Stagg among th'inraged hounds,</div><div class="l">Repells their force, and wounds returns for wounds.</div><div class="l">And as a Hero, whom his baser foes</div><div class="l">In troops surround,now these assailes,now those,</div><div class="l">Though prodigall of life,disdaines to dy</div><div class="l">By common hands ; but if he can descry</div><div class="l">Some nobler foes approach,to him he calls,</div><div class="l">And beggs his Fate, and then contented falls.</div><div class="l">So when the King a mortall shaft lets fly</div><div class="l">From his unerring hand, then glad to dy,</div><div class="l">Proud of the wound, to it resigns his blood,</div><div class="l">And staines the Christall with a Purple flood.</div><div class="l">This a more Innocent, and happy chase,</div><div class="l">Then when of old, but in the selfe-same place, [Runny Mead where the great Charter was first sealed.</div><div class="l">Faire liberty pursu'd, and meant a Prey</div><div class="l">To lawless power,here turn'd, and stood at bay.</div><div class="l">When in that remedy all hope was plac't</div><div class="l">Which was, or should have been at least,the last.</div><div class="l">Here was that Charter seal'd, wherein the Crowne [Magna Carta.</div><div class="l">All markes of Arbitrary power layes downe:</div><div class="l">Tyrant and slave, those names of hate and feare,</div><div class="l">The happier stile of King and Subject beare:</div><div class="l">Happy, when both to the samCenter move,</div><div class="l">When Kings give liberty, and Subjects love.</div><div class="l">Therefore not long in force this Charter stood;</div><div class="l">Wanting that seale, it must be seal'd in blood.</div><div class="l">The Subjects arm'd, the more their Princes gave,</div><div class="l">Th'advantage only took more to crave:</div><div class="l">Till Kings by giving, give themselves away,</div><div class="l">And even that power,that should deny, betray.</div><div class="l">"Who gives constraiu'd,but his owne feare reviles,</div><div class="l">"Not thank't,but scorn'd; nor are they gifts, but (spoyles.</div><div class="l">Thus Kings,by grasping more then they could, hold,</div><div class="l">First made their Subjects by oppression bold :</div><div class="l">And popular sway, by forcing Kings to give</div><div class="l">More then was fit for Subjects to receive,</div><div class="l">Ran to the same extreames ; and one excesse,</div><div class="l">Made both, by striving to be greater, lesse.</div><div class="l">When a calme River rais'd with sudden raines,</div><div class="l">Or Snowes dissolv'd,o're flowes th'adjoyning Plaines,</div><div class="l">The Husbandmen with high-rais'd banks secure</div><div class="l">They greedy hopes, and this he can endure.</div><div class="l">But if with bayes, and Dammes they strive to force</div><div class="l">His channell to a new, or narrow course;</div><div class="l">No longer then within his banks he dwels,</div><div class="l">First to a Torrent, then a Deluge swels:</div><div class="l">Stronger, and fiercer by restraint he roares,</div><div class="l">And knows no bound,but
