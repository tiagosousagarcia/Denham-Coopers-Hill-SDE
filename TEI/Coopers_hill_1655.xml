               <l>IF there be Poets,which did never dreame</l>
               <l> Upon Parnassus, nor did tast the streame</l>
               <l> Of Helicon, we justly may suppose,</l>
               <l> Those made not Poets, but the Poets those.</l>
               <l> And as Courts make not Kings, but Kings the Court,</l>
               <l> So where the Muses and their traine resort,</l>
               <l> Parnassus stands ; if I can be to thee</l>
               <l> A Poet, thou Parnassus art to mee.</l>
               <l> Nor wonder, if( advantag'd in my flight,</l>
               <l> By taking wing from thy auspicious height )</l>
               <l> Through untrac't waies, and ayrie paths I flye,</l>
               <l> More boundlesse in my Fancy, then my eye:</l>
               <l> My eye, which swift as thought contracts the space</l>
               <l> That lyes between,and first salutes the place</l>
               <l> Crown'd with that sacred pile,so vast,so high,</l>
               <l> That whether 'tis a part of Earth,or sky,</l>
               <l> Uncertaine seemes, and may be thought a proud</l>
               <l> Aspiring mountain, or a falling cloud,</l>
               <l> Pauls,the late theme of such a Muse whose flight [Master Waler.</l>
               <l> Has bravely reach't and soar'd above thy height:</l>
               <l> Now shalt thou stand, though sword, or time,or fire,</l>
               <l> Or zeale more fierce then they, thy fall conspire,</l>
               <l> Secure, whilst thee the best of Poets sings,</l>
               <l> Preserv'd from ruine by the best of Kings.</l>
               <l> Vunder his proud survay the Citty lyes,</l>
               <l> And like a mist beneath a hill doth rise;</l>
               <l> Whose state and wealth,the busines and the crowd,</l>
               <l> Seems at this distance but a darker cloud:</l>
               <l> And is to him,who rightly things esteems,</l>
               <l> No other in effect then what it seems:</l>
               <l> Where with like hast, through several waies, they run,</l>
               <l> Some to undo,and some to be undone;</l>
               <l> While luxury, and wealth,like war and peace,</l>
               <l> Are each the others ruine, and increase;</l>
               <l> As Rivers lost in Seas some secret veine</l>
               <l> Thence reconveighs,there to be lost again.</l>
               <l> Oh happinesse of sweet retir'd content !</l>
               <l> To be at once secure,and innocent.</l>
               <l> Windsor the next ( where Mars with Venus dwells, [Windsor.</l>
               <l> Beauty with strength ) above the valley swells</l>
               <l> Into my eye, and doth it self present</l>
               <l> With such an easie and unforc't ascent,</l>
               <l> That no stupendious precipice denyes</l>
               <l> Accesse, no horror turnes away our eyes:</l>
               <l> But such a Rise, as doth at once invite</l>
               <l> A pleasure, and a reverence from the sight.</l>
               <l> Thy mighty Masters Embleme, in whose face</l>
               <l> Sate meeknesse,heightned with Majestick Grace.</l>
               <l> Such seems thy gentle height, made onely proud</l>
               <l> To be the basis of that pompous load,</l>
               <l> Then which, a Nobler weight not Mountain Bears,</l>
               <l> But Atlas only that supports the Sphears.</l>
               <l> When Natures hand this ground did thus advance,</l>
               <l> 'Twas guided by a wiser power then Chance;</l>
               <l> Mark't out for such a use,as if 'twere meant</l>
               <l> T'invite the builder,and his choice prevent.</l>
               <l> Nor can we call it choice, when what we chuse,</l>
               <l> Folly, or blindnes only could refuse.</l>
               <l> A Crown of such Majestick towrs doth Grace</l>
               <l> The Gods great Mother, when her heavenly race</l>
               <l> Doe homage to her, yet she cannot boast</l>
               <l> Amongst that numerous, and Celestiall hoast,</l>
               <l> More Hero's than can VVindsor,nor doth Fames</l>
               <l> Immortall booke record more noble names.</l>
               <l> Not to look back so far, to whom this Ile</l>
               <l> Owes the first Glory so brave a pile,</l>
               <l> Whether to CÃ¦sar, Albanact, or Brute,</l>
               <l> The Brittish Arthur,or the Danish Knute,</l>
               <l> (Though this of old no lesse contest did move,</l>
               <l> Then when for Homers birth seven Cities strove)</l>
               <l> (Like him in birth,thou should'st be like in Fame,</l>
               <l> As thine his fate, if mine had been his Flame)</l>
               <l> But whosoere it was, Nature design'd</l>
               <l> First a brave place, and then as brave a minde.</l>
               <l> Not to recount those severall Kings, to whom</l>
               <l> It gave a Cradle, or to whom a Tombe,</l>
               <l> But thee (great Edward) and thy greater sonne, [Edward the 3. and the black
                  Prince.</l>
               <l> (The lillies which his Father wore, he wonne)</l>
               <l> And thy Bellona, who the Consort came</l>
               <l> Not onely to thy bed, but to thy Fame, [Queene Philip.</l>
               <l> She to thy Triumph led one Captive King, [The Kings of France &amp;
                  Scot-land.</l>
               <l> And brought that sonne, which did the second bring.</l>
               <l> Then didst thou found that Order( whither love,</l>
               <l> Or victory thy Royall thoughts did move)</l>
               <l> Each was a noble cause, and nothing lesse,</l>
               <l> Then the designe, has been the great successe :</l>
               <l> Which forraigne Kings, and Emperors esteeme</l>
               <l> The second Honour to their Diadem.</l>
               <l> Had thy great destiny but given thee skill,</l>
               <l> To know as well, as power to act her will,</l>
               <l> That from those Kings, who then thy captives were,</l>
               <l> In after-times should spring a Royall paire,</l>
               <l> Who should possesse all that thy mighty power,</l>
               <l> Or thy desires more mighty, did devoure ;</l>
               <l> To whom their better Fate reserves what ere</l>
               <l> The Victor hopes for, or the Vanquisht feare;</l>
               <l> That blood,which thou and thy great Grandsire shed,</l>
               <l> And all that since these sister Nations bled,</l>
               <l> Had bin unspilt, had happy Edward known</l>
               <l> That all the blood he spilt, had been his own.</l>
               <l> When he that Patron chose,in whom are joyn'd</l>
               <l> Souldier and Martyr,and his arms confin'd</l>
               <l> Within the Azure Circle, he did seem</l>
               <l> But to foretel, and prophecie of him,</l>
               <l> Who to his Realms that Azure round hath joyn'd,</l>
               <l> Which Nature for their bound at first design'd.</l>
               <l> That bound,which to the Worlds extreamest ends,</l>
               <l> Endlesse it selfe,its liquid arms extends;</l>
               <l> He, who not needs that Embleme which we paint,</l>
               <l> But is himself the Souldier and the Saint.</l>
               <l> Here should my wonder dwell,and here my praise,</l>
               <l> But my fixt thoughts my wandring eye betrays,</l>
               <l> Viewing a neighboring hill, whose top of late</l>
               <l> A Chappel crown'd,till in the Common Fate,</l>
               <l> The adjoyning Abby fell:( may no such storme</l>
               <l> Fall on our times, where ruine must reform.)</l>
               <l> Tell me ( my Muse ) what monstrous dire Offence,</l>
               <l> What crime could any Christian incense</l>
               <l> To such a rage? was't Luxury? or lust?</l>
               <l> Was he so temperate,so chast,so just?</l>
               <l> Were these their crimes? they were his own much (more:</l>
               <l> But wealth is Crime enough to him that's poor,</l>
               <l> Who having spent the Treasures of his Crown,</l>
               <l> Condemns their Luxury to feed his own.</l>
               <l> And yet this Act, to varnish o're the shame</l>
               <l> Of sacriledge,must bear devotions name.</l>
               <l> No Crime so bold,but would be understood</l>
               <l> A reall,or at least a seeming good.</l>
               <l> Who fears not to do ill,yet fears the Name,</l>
               <l> And free from Conscience,is a slave to Fame.</l>
               <l> Thus he the Church at once protects, and spoyles:</l>
               <l> But Princes swords are sharper then their styles.</l>
               <l> And thus to th'ages past he makes amends,</l>
               <l> Their Charity destroyes,their Faith defends.</l>
               <l> Then did Religion in a lazieCell ,</l>
               <l> In emptie, airie contemplations dwell;</l>
               <l> And like the block, unmoved lay : but ours,</l>
               <l> As much too active, like the storke devours.</l>
               <l> Is there no temperate Region can be knowne,</l>
               <l> Betwixt their Frigid,and our Torrid Zone?</l>
               <l> Could we not wake from that Lethargicke Dreame,</l>
               <l> But to be restlesse in a worse extreame?</l>
               <l> And for that Lethargy was there no cure,</l>
               <l> But to be cast into a Calenture?</l>
               <l> Can knowledge have no bound,but must advance</l>
               <l> So farre, to make us wish for ignorance?</l>
               <l> And rather in the darke to grope our way,</l>
               <l> Then led by a false guide to erre by day?</l>
               <l> Who sees these dismall heaps,but would demand,</l>
               <l> What barbarous Jnvader sackt the land?</l>
               <l> But when he heares,no Goth,no Turk did bring</l>
               <l> This desolation,but a Christian King;</l>
               <l> When nothing, but the Name of Zeale,appeares</l>
               <l> 'Twixt our best actions and the worst of theirs,</l>
               <l> What does he think our Sacriledge would spare,</l>
               <l> When such th'effects of our devotions are?</l>
               <l> Parting from thence 'twixt anger,shame,and feare,</l>
               <l> Those for what's past, and this for what's too neare:</l>
               <l> My eye descending from the Hill,survaies</l>
               <l> Where Thames amongst the wanton vallies strayes.</l>
               <l> Thames, the most lov'd of all the Oceans sonnes, [Thames.</l>
               <l> By his old Sire, to his imbraces runnes,</l>
               <l> Hasting to pay his tribute to the Sea,</l>
               <l> Like mortall life to meet Eternity.</l>
               <l> Though with those streames he no resemblance hold,</l>
               <l> Whose foame is Amber,and their Gravell Gold;</l>
               <l> His genuine, and lesse guilty wealth t'explore,</l>
               <l> Search not his bottom, but survey his shore ;</l>
               <l> Ore which he kindly spreads his spacious wing,</l>
               <l> And hatches plenty for th'ensuing Spring.</l>
               <l> Nor then destroyes it with too fond a stay,</l>
               <l> Like Mothers which their Infats overlay.</l>
               <l> Nor with a suddain and impetuous wave,</l>
               <l> Like profuse Kings, resumes the wealth he gave.</l>
               <l> No unexpected inundations spoyle</l>
               <l> The mowers hopes, nor mock the plowmans toyle :</l>
               <l> But Godlike his unwearled Bounty flows ;</l>
               <l> First loves to do, then loves the Good he does.</l>
               <l> Nor are his Blessings to his banks confin'd,</l>
               <l> But free,and common,as the Sea or Wind ;</l>
               <l> When he to boast, or to disperse his stores</l>
               <l> Full of the tributes of his gratefull shores,</l>
               <l> Visits the World, and in his flying towers</l>
               <l> Brings home to us, and makes both Indies ours;</l>
               <l> Finds wealth where 'tis, bestows it where it wants,</l>
               <l> Citties in deserts, woods in Cities plants.</l>
               <l> So that to us no thing, no place is strange,</l>
               <l> While his fayre bosome is the worlds exchange.</l>
               <l> O could I flow like thee, and make thy streame</l>
               <l> My great example,as it is my theme !</l>
               <l> Though deep,yet cleare,though Gentle,yet not dull,</l>
               <l> Strong without rage, without 'ore-flowing full.</l>
               <l> Here Nature, whether more intent to please [The Forrest.</l>
               <l> Us,or her selfe, with strange varieties,</l>
               <l> (For things of wonder give no lesse delight</l>
               <l> To the wise Maker's,then beholder's sight.</l>
               <l> Though these delights from severall causes move,</l>
               <l> For so our children, thus our friends we love)</l>
               <l> Wisely she knew, the harmony of things,</l>
               <l> As well as that of sounds, from discords springs.</l>
               <l> Such was the discord, which did first disperse</l>
               <l> Forme,order, beauty through the Universe;</l>
               <l> While drynesse moysture, coldnesse heat resists,</l>
               <l> All that we have,and that we are, subsists.</l>
               <l> While the steepe horrid roughnesse of the Wood</l>
               <l> Strives with the gentle calmenesse of the flood.</l>
               <l> Such huge extreames when Nature doth unite,</l>
               <l> Wonder from thence results, from thence delight.</l>
               <l> The streame is so transparent,pure,and cleare,</l>
               <l> That had the selfe-enamour'd youth gaz'd here, [Narcis-sus.</l>
               <l> So fatally deceiv'd he had not been,</l>
               <l> While he the bottome,not his face had seene.</l>
               <l> But his proud head the ayery Mountaine hides</l>
               <l> Among the Clouds ; his shoulders,and his sides</l>
               <l> A shady mantle cloaths; his curled brows</l>
               <l> Frowne on the Gentle streame, which calmly flows,</l>
               <l> While winds and stormes his lofty forhead beat :</l>
               <l> The common fate of all that's high, or great.</l>
               <l> Low at his foot a spacious plaine is plac't,</l>
               <l> Between the mountaine and the streame imbrac't :</l>
               <l> Which shade and shelter from the Hill derives,</l>
               <l> While the kind river wealth and beauty gives ;</l>
               <l> And in the mixture of all these appeares</l>
               <l> Variety, which all the rest indears.</l>
               <l> This scene had some bold Greek, or Brittish Bard</l>
               <l> Beheld of old, what stories had we heard,</l>
               <l> Of Faries, Satyrs,and the Nymphs their Dames,</l>
               <l> Their feasts, their revells,and their amorous flames!</l>
               <l> 'Tis still the same, although their ayery shape</l>
               <l> All but a quick Poetick sight escape.</l>
               <l> There Faunus and Sylvanus keepe their Courts,</l>
               <l> And thither all the horned hoast resorts,</l>
               <l> To graze the rancker meade,that noble heard,</l>
               <l> On whose sublime and shady fronts is reard</l>
               <l> Natures great Masterpeece ; to shew how soone</l>
               <l> Great things are made,but sooner are undone.</l>
               <l> Here have I seene the King, when great affaires</l>
               <l> Give leave to slacken, and unbend his cares,</l>
               <l> Attended to the Chase by all the flower</l>
               <l> Of youth,whose hopes a Nobler prey devoure:</l>
               <l> Pleasure with Praise, and danger,they would buy,</l>
               <l> And with a foe that would not only fly.</l>
               <l> The stagg now conscious of his fatall Growth,</l>
               <l> At once indulgent to his feare and sloth,</l>
               <l> To some darke covert his retreat had made,</l>
               <l> Where nor mans eye, nor heavens should invade</l>
               <l> His soft repose ; when th'unexpected sound</l>
               <l> Of doggs, and men,his wakefull eare doth wound.</l>
               <l> Rouz'd with the noyse, he scarse believes his eare,</l>
               <l> Willing to think th'illusions of his feare</l>
               <l> Had given this false Alar'm,but straight his view</l>
               <l> Confirmes,that more than all he feares is true.</l>
               <l> Betray'd in all his strengths, the wood beset,</l>
               <l> All instruments, all Arts of ruine met ;</l>
               <l> He calls to mind his strength, and then his speed,</l>
               <l> His winged heeles, and then his armed head;</l>
               <l> With these t'avoyd, with that his Fateto meet :</l>
               <l> But feare prevails, and bids him trust his feet.</l>
               <l> So fast he flyes, that his reviewing eye</l>
               <l> Has lost the chasers, their Nobler sense</l>
               <l> Their disproportion'd speed does recompense.</l>
               <l> Then curses his conspiring feet, whose scent</l>
               <l> Betrayes that safety which their swiftnesse lent.</l>
               <l> Then tryes his friends, among the baser heard,</l>
               <l> Where he so lately was obey'd, and fear'd,</l>
               <l> His safety seeks:the heard, unkindly wise,</l>
               <l> Or chases him from thence, or from him flyes.</l>
               <l> Like a declining Statesman,left forlorne</l>
               <l> To his friends pitty,and pursuers scorne,</l>
               <l> With shame remembers, while himsefe was one</l>
               <l> Of the same heard,himselfe the same had done.</l>
               <l> Thence to the coverts,and the conscious Groves,</l>
               <l> The scenes of his past triumphs,and his loves;</l>
               <l> Sadly surveying where he rang'd alone</l>
               <l> Prince of the soyle,and all the heard his owne ;</l>
               <l> And like a bold Knight Errant did proclaime</l>
               <l> Combat to all,and bore away the Dame;</l>
               <l> And taught the woods to eccho to the streame</l>
               <l> His dreadfull challenge,and his clashing beame.</l>
               <l> Yet faintly now declines the fatall strife ;</l>
               <l> So much his love was dearer then his life.</l>
               <l> Now every lease, and every moving breath</l>
               <l> Presents a foe, and every foe a death.</l>
               <l> Wearied, forsaken, and pursu'd, at last</l>
               <l> All safety in despaire of safety plac'd,</l>
               <l> Courage he thence resumes, resolv'd to beare</l>
               <l> All their assaults,since 'tis in vaine to feare.</l>
               <l> And now too late he wishes for the fight</l>
               <l> That strength he wasted in Ignoble flight :</l>
               <l> But when he sees the eager chase renew'd,</l>
               <l> Himselfe by doggs, the doggs by men pursu'd :</l>
               <l> He striaght revokes his bold resolve, and more</l>
               <l> Repents his courage,then his feare before ;</l>
               <l> Finds that uncertaine waies unsafest are,</l>
               <l> And Doubt a greater mischief then Despaire.</l>
               <l> Then to the streame, when neither friends, norforce,</l>
               <l> Nor speed,nor Art availe, he shapes his course;</l>
               <l> Thinks not their rage so desperate t' assay,</l>
               <l> An Element, more mercilesse then they.</l>
               <l> But feareless they pursue, nor can the flood</l>
               <l> Quench their dire thirst ; alas, they thirst for blood.</l>
               <l> So towards a Ship the oarefin'd Gallyes ply,</l>
               <l> Which wanting Sea to ride, or wind to fly,</l>
               <l> Stands but to fall reveng'd on those that dare</l>
               <l> Tempt the last fury of extreame despayre.</l>
               <l> So fares the Stagg among th'inraged hounds,</l>
               <l> Repells their force, and wounds returns for wounds.</l>
               <l> And as a Hero, whom his baser foes</l>
               <l> In troops surround,now these assailes,now those,</l>
               <l> Though prodigall of life,disdaines to dy</l>
               <l> By common hands ; but if he can descry</l>
               <l> Some nobler foes approach,to him he calls,</l>
               <l> And beggs his Fate, and then contented falls.</l>
               <l> So when the King a mortall shaft lets fly</l>
               <l> From his unerring hand, then glad to dy,</l>
               <l> Proud of the wound, to it resigns his blood,</l>
               <l> And staines the Christall with a Purple flood.</l>
               <l> This a more Innocent, and happy chase,</l>
               <l> Then when of old, but in the selfe-same place, [Runny Mead where the great
                  Charter was first sealed.</l>
               <l> Faire liberty pursu'd, and meant a Prey</l>
               <l> To lawless power,here turn'd, and stood at bay.</l>
               <l> When in that remedy all hope was plac't</l>
               <l> Which was, or should have been at least,the last.</l>
               <l> Here was that Charter seal'd, wherein the Crowne [Magna Carta.</l>
               <l> All markes of Arbitrary power layes downe:</l>
               <l> Tyrant and slave, those names of hate and feare,</l>
               <l> The happier stile of King and Subject beare:</l>
               <l> Happy, when both to the samCenter move,</l>
               <l> When Kings give liberty, and Subjects love.</l>
               <l> Therefore not long in force this Charter stood;</l>
               <l> Wanting that seale, it must be seal'd in blood.</l>
               <l> The Subjects arm'd, the more their Princes gave,</l>
               <l> Th'advantage only took more to crave:</l>
               <l> Till Kings by giving, give themselves away,</l>
               <l> And even that power,that should deny, betray.</l>
               <l> "Who gives constraiu'd,but his owne feare reviles,</l>
               <l> "Not thank't,but scorn'd; nor are they gifts, but (spoyles.</l>
               <l> Thus Kings,by grasping more then they could, hold,</l>
               <l> First made their Subjects by oppression bold :</l>
               <l> And popular sway, by forcing Kings to give</l>
               <l> More then was fit for Subjects to receive,</l>
               <l> Ran to the same extreames ; and one excesse,</l>
               <l> Made both, by striving to be greater, lesse.</l>
               <l> When a calme River rais'd with sudden raines,</l>
               <l> Or Snowes dissolv'd,o're flowes th'adjoyning Plaines,</l>
               <l> The Husbandmen with high-rais'd banks secure</l>
               <l> They greedy hopes, and this he can endure.</l>
               <l> But if with bayes, and Dammes they strive to force</l>
               <l> His channell to a new, or narrow course;</l>
               <l> No longer then within his banks he dwels,</l>
               <l> First to a Torrent, then a Deluge swels:</l>
               <l> Stronger, and fiercer by restraint he roares,</l>
               <l> And knows no bound,but makes his power his shores.</l>
